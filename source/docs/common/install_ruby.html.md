title: Installing Ruby
---

Ruby can easily be installed on a variety of operating systems. See the [Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for more details, or the operating system-specific sections below for additional suggestions.

The RubyGems package management framework can be installed on all operating systems supported by Ruby. See the [RubyGems website](http://rubygems.org/) for more details.

* [Ruby on Linux](#linux)
* [Ruby on Mac OS X](#osx)
* [Ruby on Windows](#windows)

## <a id="linux"></a>Ruby on Linux

There are two good Ruby environment managers available for Linux and Unix-like systems - rvm and rbenv. These environment managers make it easier to manage your Ruby environment and to keep up to date with the latest Ruby releases. These environment managers include RubyGems.

* [rvm installation instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/)
* [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#installation)

Ruby can also be installed using the package manager available for each Linux distribution - `apt` on Ubuntu and Debian, `yum` on RedHat/Fedora and Centos, or `yast` on SuSE Linux. When installing using a package manager, install the "ruby" and "rubygems" packages. 

## <a id="osx"></a>Ruby on Mac OS X

OS X version 10.5 and higher ship with Ruby installed, but it may not be the latest version of Ruby. Use of a Ruby environment manager is recommended, as these make it easier to manage your Ruby environment and to keep up to date with the latest Ruby releases. There are two good Ruby environment managers available for OS X - rvm and rbenv. These environment managers include RubyGems.  

* [rvm installation instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/)
* [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#installation)

These environment managers, or a newer version of Ruby and RubyGems directly, can also be installed using the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package manager. 

## <a id="windows"></a>Ruby on Windows

The RubyInstaller project can be used to easily install Ruby on Windows.

* [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/)

There is also a Ruby environment manager available for Windows, named pik.
