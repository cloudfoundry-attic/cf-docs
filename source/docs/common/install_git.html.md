title: Installing Git
---

A Git command line client ships with many operating systems, so you may already have it. You can check by simply running this command at a command line:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git --version
</pre>

Git can easily be installed on most operating systems. See the [Git website](http://git-scm.com/downloads) for more details.

Git can also be installed using the package manager available for most Linux distributions and Mac OS X - `apt` on Ubuntu and Debian, `yum` on RedHat/Fedora and Centos, `yast` on SuSE Linux, and [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on OS X. 

Git GUI clients are also available for most operating systems, but all examples in this documentation use the `git` command line client for simplicity.
