title: Using Cloud Foundry
---

Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of developer frameworks and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications. 

A deployment of the Cloud Foundry platform by a Cloud Foundry provider will include support for a number of runtimes and services. Runtimes and services that are included in the [Cloud Foundry Core Definition](http://core.cloudfoundry.org/definition) are covered in this documentation. Refer to your provider's documentation for information on the runtimes and services they support. 

## Scope of this documentation 

This documentation is forward looking and favors 'next generation' components which may not be applicable to existing Cloud Foundry deployments. 

## Runtimes

The following sections contain detailed information on deploying applications to the core Cloud Foundry runtimes, including the frameworks available on each runtime and details on using services with each runtime and framework.
