title: Using Services
---

This documentation is intended for end users of Cloud Foundry and covers provisioning of service instances and integrating them with applications that have been pushed to Cloud Foundry. If you are interested in building Services for Cloud Foundry and making them available to end users, see [Running Services](../../running/architecture/services/).

## Services and Service Instances ##

Cloud Foundry Services enable end users to provision a resource on demand. Examples of a resource a service might provide are databases on a multi-tenant server, or simply accounts on a SaaS application.

These resources are known as Service Instances. Think of a service as a factory which produces service instances.

## Binding ##

Some services support the concept of Binding. Applications pushed to Cloud Foundry can be bound with service instances that support this feature. When an application is bound to a service instance, information about the service instance (such as location and account credentials) is written to an environment variable in the application runtime called [VCAP_SERVICES]((../deploying-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP_SERVICES). The application can use this information to integrate with the service instance.

## User-provided Service Instances ##

There are two ways in which Cloud Foundry enables developers to provision services, Managed Services and [User-provided Service Instances](user-provided.html). Managed Services have been integrated with Cloud Foundry via APIs and enable end-users to provision new service instances and credentials on demand. User-provided Service Instances are a mechanism to deliver credentials to applications for service instances which have been pre-provisioned outside of Cloud Foundry.
