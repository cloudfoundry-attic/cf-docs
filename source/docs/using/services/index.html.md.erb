title: Using Services
---

Cloud Foundry Services are any type of add-on that can be provisioned alongside your application; for example, a database or an account on a third-party SaaS provider.

Some services support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in an environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES` in JSON format that are visible to the application process.

If you are operating your own instance of Cloud Foundry and are interested in binding applications to services which are external to Cloud Foundry, see [Service Connector](/docs/running/architecture/services/service-connector.html).

## <a id='configuring'></a>Configuring Connections for Different Frameworks ##
 
The procedure for configuring an application to connect to a service varies by framework. Note that auto-configuration is not supported for all frameworks. The table below has links to instructions for configuring service connections in different environments.  

| Runtime               | Framework                   |
