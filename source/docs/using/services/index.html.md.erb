title: Using Services
---

Cloud Foundry Services are any type of add-on that can be provisioned alongside your application; for example, a database or an account on a third-party SaaS provider.

A service may support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service instance is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in a `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable in JSON format that are visible to the application process.

If you are operating your own instance of Cloud Foundry and are interested in binding applications to services which are external to Cloud Foundry, see [Service Connector](/docs/running/architecture/services/service-connector.html).

## <a id='configuring'></a>Configuring Services with Application Frameworks ##
 
Some application frameworks support Cloud Foundry Services directly. This means that they are able to read the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable and automate aspects of using the service. The procedure for configuring an application to connect to a service varies by application framework. Note that auto-configuration is not supported for all frameworks. The table below has links to instructions for configuring service connections in different environments.
