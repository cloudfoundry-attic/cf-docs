title: Play Framework - Service Bindings
---
Cloud Foundry provides support for connecting a Play Framework application to services such as MySQL, and Postgres.  In many cases, a Play Framework application running on Cloud Foundry can automatically detect and configure connections to services.


## <a id='auto'></a>Auto-Configuration ##
By default, Cloud Foundry will detect service connections in a Play Framework application and configure them to use the credentials provided in the Cloud Foundry environment. Auto-configuration will only happen if there is a single service of any of the supported types - MySQL or Postgres.
