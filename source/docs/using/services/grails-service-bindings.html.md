title: Grails - Service Bindings
---

Cloud Foundry provides extensive support for connecting a Grails application to services such as MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ. In many cases, a Grails application running on Cloud Foundry can automatically detect and configure connections to services. For more advanced cases, you can control service connection parameters yourself. 

## <a id="auto"></a>Auto-Configuration ##

Grails provides plugins for accessing SQL (using [Hibernate](http://grails.org/plugin/hibernate)), [MongoDB](http://www.grails.org/plugin/mongodb), and [Redis](http://grails.org/plugin/redis) services. If you install any of these plugins and configure them in your `Config.groovy` or `DataSource.groovy` file, the Cloud Foundry Grails plugin will re-configure the plugins when the app starts to provide the connection information to the plugins. 

To enable auto-configuration of service connections, add the `cloudfoundry-runtime` library to the `dependencies` section in your `BuildConfig.groovy` file, and add the `cloud-foundry` plugin to the `plugins` section. You will also need the Spring Framework Milestone repository in the `repositories` section. **For Cloud Foundry v2 support, the version of `cloudfoundry-runtime` must be at least `0.8.4`**:

~~~groovy
  repositories {
    grailsHome()
    mavenCentral()
    grailsCentral()
    mavenRepo "http://maven.springframework.org/milestone/"
  }

  dependencies {
    compile "org.cloudfoundry:cloudfoundry-runtime:0.8.4"
  }

  plugins {
    compile ':cloud-foundry:1.2.3'
  }
~~~

If you were using all three types of services, your configuration might look like this: 

~~~groovy
environments {
  production {
    dataSource {
      url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost/db?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8'
      dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect
      driverClassName = 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'
      username = 'user'
      password = "password"
    }
    grails {
      mongo {
        host = 'localhost'
        port = 27107
        databaseName = "foo"
        username = 'user'
        password = 'password'
      }
      redis {
        host = 'localhost'
        port = 6379
        password = 'password'
        timeout = 2000
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

The `url`, `host`, `port`, `databaseName`, `username`, and `password` fields in this configuration will be overriden by the Cloud Foundry Grails plugin if it detects that the application is running in a Cloud Foundry environment. If you want to test the application locally against your own services, you can put real values in these fields. If the application will only be run against Cloud Foundry services, you can put placeholder values as shown here, but the fields must exist in the configuration. 

## <a id="manual"></a>Manual Configuration ##

If you do not want to use the Cloud Foundry Grails plugin, you can choose to configure the Cloud Foundry service connections manually. 

The best way to do the manual configuration is to use the `cloudfoundry-runtime` library to get the details of the Cloud Foundry environment the application is running in. To use this library, add it to the `dependencies` section in your `BuildConfig.groovy` file. You will also need the Spring Framework Milestone repository in the `repositories` section. **For Cloud Foundry v2 support, the version of this library must be at least `0.8.4`**:

~~~groovy
  repositories {
    grailsHome()
    mavenCentral()
    grailsCentral()
    mavenRepo "http://maven.springframework.org/milestone/"
  }

  dependencies {
    compile "org.cloudfoundry:cloudfoundry-runtime:0.8.4"
  }
~~~

Then you can use the `cloudfoundry-runtime` API in your `DataSources.groovy` file to set the connection parameters. If you were using all three types of database services as in the auto-configuration example, and the services were named "myapp-mysql", "myapp-mongodb", and "myapp-redis", your `DataSources.groovy` file might look like the one below. 

~~~groovy
import org.cloudfoundry.runtime.env.CloudEnvironment
import org.cloudfoundry.runtime.env.RdbmsServiceInfo
import org.cloudfoundry.runtime.env.RedisServiceInfo
import org.cloudfoundry.runtime.env.MongoServiceInfo

def cloudEnv = new CloudEnvironment()

environments {
  production {
    dataSource {
      pooled = true
      dbCreate = 'update'
      driverClassName = 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'

      if (cloudEnv.isCloudFoundry()) {
        def dbInfo = cloudEnv.getServiceInfo('myapp-mysql', RdbmsServiceInfo.class)
        url = dbInfo.url
        username = dbInfo.userName
        password = dbInfo.password
      } else {
        url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:5432/myapp'
        username = 'sa'
        password = ''
      }
    }
    
    grails {
      mongo {
        if (cloudEnv.isCloudFoundry()) {
          def mongoInfo = cloudEnv.getServiceInfo('myapp-mongodb', MongoServiceInfo.class)
          host = mongoInfo.host
          port = mongoInfo.port
          databaseName = mongoInfo.database
          username = mongoInfo.userName
          password = mongoInfo.password
        } else {
          host = 'localhost'
          port = 27107
          databaseName = 'foo'
          username = 'user'
          password = 'password'
        }
      }
      redis {
        if (cloudEnv.isCloudFoundry()) {
          def redisInfo = cloudEnv.getServiceInfo('myapp-redis', RedisServiceInfo.class)
          host = redisInfo.host
          port = redisInfo.port
          password = redisInfo.password
        } else {
          host = 'localhost'
          port = 6379
          password = 'password'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
