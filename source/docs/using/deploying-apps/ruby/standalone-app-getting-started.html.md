title: Standalone, Getting Started

## <a id='intro'></a>Introduction ##

Cloud Foundry supports running standalone applications. This guide will show you how to create a standalone application that will execute ruby code at a given interval using the Clockwork gem.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites ##

To complete this quickstart guide, you need to fulfill the following prerequisites;

* A Cloud Foundry account, you can sign up [here](https://my.cloudfoundry.com/signup)
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/)
* The [VMC](../../managing-apps/) command line tool 

## <a id='sample-project'></a>Creating a Sample Project ##

Create a folder for your Standalone application and create a basic application structure.

<pre class="terminal">
$ mkdir ruby_scheduler
$ cd ruby_scheduler
$ touch scheduler.rb Gemfile
</pre>

Initialise both files as follows;

Gemfile

~~~ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'clockwork'
~~~

scheduler.rb

~~~ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'clockwork'

class Job
  
  def do_job(frequency)
    puts "Doing job for #{frequency}"
  end

end

include Clockwork

handler do |frequency|

  job = Job.new
  job.do_job(frequency)

end

every(1.hour, :hour)
every(1.day, :day)
every(1.week, :week)

Clockwork::run
~~~

As shown in the code above the, every hour, day and week the a job class is created and the method 'do_job' is called. 

Install the required Clockwork gem using bundler

<pre class="terminal">
$ bundle install
</pre>

You should be able to run the application locally by making scheduler.rb executable and running it;

<pre class="terminal">
$ chmod +x scheduler.rb
$ ./scheduler.rb

Doing job for week
</pre>

## <a id='deploying'></a>Deploying Your Application ##

Push the application with VMC;

<pre class="terminal">
$ vmc push

Create services for application?> n

Bind other services to application?> n

Save configuration?> n

Uploading scheduler... OK
Starting scheduler... OK
Checking scheduler... OK
</pre>

As shown above when asked for the application type, select 'standalone' and then when asked for a startup command enter 'bundle exec ./scheduler.rb'

Once this is deployed, we can check it is running correctly by viewing the stdout log;

<pre class="terminal">
$ vmc file scheduler logs/stdout.log
Getting file contents... OK
