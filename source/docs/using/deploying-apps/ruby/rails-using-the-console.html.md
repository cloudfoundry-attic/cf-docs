title: Rails 3, Using the Console
---

## <a id='intro'></a>Introduction ##

**Rails Console is not yet available for Cloud Foundry v2**.

## <a id='invoke'></a>Invoking the console ##

Once Rails Console support is available on Cloud Foundry v2, you will be able to invoke the console with a command like:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf console [application name]
Opening console on port 10000... OK
irb():001:0>
</pre>

The familiar IRB-style console should open with a live connection to the Rails application.
