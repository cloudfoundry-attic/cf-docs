title: Cloud Foundry Environment Variables
---
Environment variables are the means by which the Cloud Foundry runtime communicates with a deployed application about its environment. This page describes the environment variables that Droplet Execution Agents (DEAs) and buildpacks set for applications.

For information about setting your own application-specific environment variables, see [Set Environment Variable in a Manifest](/docs/using/deploying-apps/manifest.html#var) on the [Application Manifests](/docs/using/deploying-apps/manifest.html) page.

## <a id='view'></a>View Environment Variable Values ##
The sections below describe methods of viewing the values of Cloud Foundry environment variables.

### <a id='cli'></a>View Environment Variables using CLI ###

The cf command line interface provides two commands that can return environment variables. For more information see [logs](/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html#logs) and [files](/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html#files) on [cf Command Line Interface](/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html).

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf files APP_NAME_HERE logs/env.log
</pre>

### <a id='app'></a>Access Environment Variables Programmatically ###

The sections below show how to access an environment variable from a program. These examples obtain the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable

### Java

```
System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");
```

### Ruby

```
ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']
```

### Node.js

```
process.env.VCAP_SERVICES
```

## <a id='dea-set'></a>Variables Defined by the DEA ##

The subsections that follow describe the environment variables set by a DEA for an application at staging time.

### <a id='HOME'></a>HOME ###
Root folder for the deployed application.  

`HOME=/home/vcap/app`

### <a id='HOME'></a>MEMORY_LIMIT ###
The maximum amount of memory that each instance of the application can consume. This value is set as a result of the value you specify in an application manifest, or at the command line when pushing an application.   

If an instance goes over the maximum limit, it will be restarted. If it has to be restarted too often, it will be terminated. 

`MEMORY_LIMIT=512m`

### <a id='PORT'></a>PORT ###
The port on the DEA for communication with the application. The DEA allocates a port to the application during staging. For this reason, code that obtains or uses the application port should reference it using `PORT`. 

`PORT=61857`

### <a id='PWD'></a>PWD ###
Identifies the present working directory, where the buildpack that processed the application ran.

`PWD=/home/vcap`

### <a id='TMPDIR'></a>TMPDIR###
Directory location where temporary and staging files are stored.

`TMPDIR=/home/vcap/tmp`

### <a id='USER'></a>USER###
The user account under which the DEA runs.

`USER=vcap`

### <a id='VCAP\_APP\_HOST'></a>VCAP\_APP\_HOST

The IP address of the DEA host.

`VCAP_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0`

### <a id='VCAP_APPLICATION'></a>VCAP_APPLICATION ###

This variable contains useful information about a deployed application. Results are retured in JSON format. The table below lists the attributes that are returned.


|Attribute|Description |
| --------- | --------- | 
|application_users, users | |
|instance_id  |GUID that identifies the application. |

### <a id='VCAP_APP_PORT'></a>VCAP\_APP\_PORT ###

Equivalent to the [PORT](#PORT) variable, defined above.

### <a id='VCAP_CONSOLE_IP'></a>VCAP\_CONSOLE\_IP ###

This is not yet implemented in V2.

The IP address upon which application users can access the Rails console.

`VCAP_CONSOLE_IP=0.0.0.0`

### <a id='VCAP\_CONSOLE\_PORT'></a>VCAP\_CONSOLE\_PORT ###
This is not yet implemented in V2.

The port (on the network interface specified by `VCAP_CONSOLE_IP`) upon which application users can access the Rails console.

`VCAP_CONSOLE_PORT=61858` 

### <a id='VCAP_SERVICES'></a>VCAP\_SERVICES ###

For most service types, Cloud Foundry will add connection details to the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable when you bind the service to the application.

The results are returned as a JSON document that contains an object for each service type of which one or more instances are bound to the application. The service type object contains a child object for each service instance of that type that is bound to the application. The attributes for a service instance vary somewhat by service type. The attributes that describe a bound service are defined in the table below.  Note that not all attributes apply to all service types.  


|Attribute|Description |
| --------- | --------- | 
|service name-version|A service type is identified by the service name and service version (if there is no version attribute, the string "n/a" is used), separated by a dash character, for example "cleardb-n/a". |
|name|The name assigned to the service instance when it was created. |
|label|Takes the same value as service name-version. |
|plan|The provider plan selected when the service was created. |
|name|The name of the database running on the service provider's server; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb instance.  |
|host |The host  for connecting to the service; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb, rediscloud, or sendgrid instance.|
|port |Port for connecting to the service; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb or rediscloud instance.  |
|username |Username for connecting to the service; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb or sendgrid instance.  |
|password |Password for connecting to the service; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb, cloudamp, or sendgrid instance.  |
|uri  |URI of the service, appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb, rediscloud, elephantsql, or mongolab instance.  |
|jdbcUrl|The JDBC URL for the database connection; appears in the "credentials" object for a cleardb instance. |


The example below contains the parsed JSON for the VCAP_SERVICE variable for a bound instance of each service type available in the Cloud Foundry Services Marketplace.

## <a id='java-buildpack'></a>Variables Defined by Java Buildpack ##

The subsections that follow describe the environment variables set by the Java Buildpack for an application at staging time.

### <a id='JAVA_HOME'></a>JAVA_HOME ###

The location of JAVA on the container running the application.

`JAVA_HOME=/home/vcap/app/.jdk`

### <a id='JAVA_OPTS'></a>JAVA_OPTS ###

The Java options to use when running the application. All values are used without modification when invoking the JVM. Can be configured in the Java buildpack’s `/config/javaopts.yml` file.

`JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m -Xms512m -Dhttp.port=61857`

### <a id='JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS'></a>JAVA\_TOOL\_OPTIONS ###

This environment variable defines Java options that are required to enable the Java buildpack to auto-configure services for a Java application that uses the Lift framework.
 
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Drun.mode=production`

## <a id='ruby-buildpack'></a>Variables Defined by Ruby Buildpack ##

The subsections that follow describe the environment variables set by the Ruby buildpack for an application at staging time.

### <a id='BUNDLE_BIN_PATH'></a>BUNDLE\_BIN\_PATH ###

Location where Bundler installs binaries.

`BUNDLE_BIN_PATH:/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.3.2/bin/bundle`

### <a id='BUNDLE_GEMFILE'></a>BUNDLE_GEMFILE ###

Path to application’s gemfile. 
 
`BUNDLE_GEMFILE:/home/vcap/app/Gemfile`

### <a id='BUNDLE_WITHOUT'></a>BUNDLE_WITHOUT ###

The `BUNDLE_WITHOUT` environment variable causes Cloud Foundry to skip installation of gems in excluded groups. `BUNDLE_WITHOUT` is particularly useful for Rails applications, where there are typically “assets” and “development” gem groups containing gems that are not needed when the app runs in production

For information about using this variable, see http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2012/10/02/polishing-cloud-foundrys-ruby-gem-support.

`BUNDLE_WITHOUT=assets`

### <a id='DATABASE_URL'></a>DATABASE_URL ###

The Ruby buildpack looks at the database\_uri for bound services to see if they match known database types. If there are known relational database services bound to the application, the buildpack sets up the DATABASE_URL environment variable with the first one in the list.

If your application depends on DATABASE\_URL being set to the connection string for your service, and Cloud Foundry does not set it, you can set this variable manually.

`$ cf set-env myapp DATABASE_URL mysql://b5d435f40dd2b2:ebfc00ac@us-cdbr-east-03.cleardb.com:3306/ad_c6f4446532610ab`

### <a id='GEM_HOME'></a>GEM_HOME ###

`GEM_HOME:/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1`

### <a id='GEM_PATH'></a>GEM_PATH ###

Location where gems can be found.

`GEM_PATH=/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1:`

### <a id='RACK_ENV'></a>RACK_ENV ###
This variable specifies the Rack deployment environment --- development, deployment, or none. This governs what middleware is loaded to run the application.
 
`RACK_ENV=production`

### <a id='RAILS_ENV'></a>RAILS_ENV ###
This variable specifies the Rails deployment environment ---  development, test, or production.  This controls which of the environment-specific configuration files will govern how the application will be executed.  

`RAILS_ENV=production`

### <a id='RUBYOPT'></a>RUBYOPT ###
This Ruby environment variable defines command-line options passed to Ruby interpreter.

`RUBYOPT: -I/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.3.2/lib -rbundler/setup`

## <a id='node-buildpack'></a>Variables Defined by Node Buildpack ##
