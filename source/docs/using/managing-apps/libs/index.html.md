title: API and Libraries
---

Cloud Foundry's Cloud Controller component implements a REST API for querying and managing a Cloud Foundry environment. The full REST API is documented in the [reference section](/docs/reference/cc-api.html) of this site. 

There are libraries available that provide language-specific bindings to the Cloud Controller REST API. 

* Java client library (vcap-java-client)

* Ruby gem (cloudfoundry-client)

* Node.js module (cf-runtime)
