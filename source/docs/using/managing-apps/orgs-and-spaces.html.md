title: Organizations and Spaces

Organizations and Spaces are the main organizational units in which applications, services, domains, routes, and users are contained. The following illustration shows the organizational units of Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='organizations'></a>Organizations ##

An organization is the top-most meta object within the Cloud Foundry infrastructure. If an account has administrative privileges on a Cloud Foundry instance, it can manage its organizations.

## <a id='spaces'></a>Spaces ##

An organization can contain multiple spaces. The defaults for a standard Cloud Foundry install are **development**, **test**, and **production**. A domain can be mapped to multiple spaces but a route can be mapped to only one space.

## <a id='managmement'></a>Management ##

You can manage spaces and organizations with the [CF](/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html) console interface, [API libraries](libs/), or [IDEs](ide/).
