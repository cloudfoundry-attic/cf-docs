## <a id="intro"></a> Introduction ##

Gradle is a build tool, that can "automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other types of projects such as generated static websites, generated documentation or indeed anything else."

There is a plugin that adds Cloud Foundry oriented tasks to a gradle project, called "gradle-cf-plugin".

## <a id="intro"></a> Adding the plugin ##

An example Gradle project with the Cloud Foundry plugin installed looks something like this (build.gradle);

~~~

buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "http://repo.springsource.org/libs-milestone-s3-cache" }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath group: 'org.gradle.api.plugins', name: 'gradle-cf-plugin', version: '0.2.0'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'cloudfoundry'

cloudfoundry {
  username = 'jondoe@gmail.com'
  password = 'mypassword'
  application = 'test_grails_app'
  framework = 'grails'
  file = new File('/path/to/app.war')
  uris = ['http://grails-test.cloudfoundry.com']
}

~~~

After adding the plugin, running the tasks command should include the following output;

<pre class="terminal">

$ gradle tasks
:tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

From this point it should be possible to carry out most tasks available as part of cf from within Gradle. For more information on configuration options within Gradle, take a look at the gradle-cf-plugin project on Github - https://github.com/melix/gradle-cf-plugin
