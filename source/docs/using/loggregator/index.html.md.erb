# Loggregator

### Logging in the Clouds 

Loggregator is the user application logging subsystem for Cloud Foundry.

### Features

Loggregator allows users to: 

1. Tail their application logs.
1. Dump a recent set of application logs (where recent is on the order of an hour).
1. Continually drain their application logs to 3rd party log archive and analysis services.

### Usage

<pre class="terminal">
cf logs [--app=APP_NAME] [--recent]
</pre>

`APP_NAME` defaults to the current application in your `manifest.yml` file.


<pre class="terminal">
$ cf logs

### Constraints

1. Loggregator collects STDOUT & STDERR from the customer's application.  This may require configuration on the developer's side.
1. A Loggregator outage must not affect the running application.
1. Loggregator gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner.  While undesirable, losing the current buffer of application logs is acceptable.
1. The 3rd party drain API should mimic Heroku's in order to reduce integration effort for our partners.  The Heroku drain API is simply remote syslog over TCP.

### Architecture

Loggregator is composed of:

* **Sources**: Logging agents that run on the Cloud Foundry components.  They forward logs to:
* **Loggregator Server**: Responsible for gathering logs from the **sources**, and storing in the temporary buffers.
* **Hashing Layer**: Makes the Loggregator Servers horizontally scalable by partitioning incoming log messages and outgoing traffic. Routes incoming log messages and proxies outgoing connections to the CLI and to drains for 3rd party partners.

Source agents emit the logging data as [protocol-buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/), and the data stays in that format throughout the system.
