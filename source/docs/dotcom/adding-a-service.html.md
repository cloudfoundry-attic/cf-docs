Cloud Foundry allows you to deploy applications without worrying about configuration headaches, making it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale your app.

This guide walks you through binding and using services at run.pivotal.io. It assumes you have pushed an application to run.pivotal.io. If you haven't done, that, you might consider going through our guide, [Getting Started](getting-started.html).
