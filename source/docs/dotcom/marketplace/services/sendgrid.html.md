[SendGrid's](http://sendgrid.com)  cloud-based email infrastructure relieves businesses of the cost and complexity of maintaining custom email systems. SendGrid provides reliable delivery, scalability and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs that make custom integration a breeze.

## <a id='managing'></a>Managing Services ##

To create and bind a new SendGrid service, see [Managing Services from the Command Line](../../../using/services/managing-services.html).

### Creating A SendGrid Service ##

SendGrid can be provisioned with the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service sendgrid [service-name] [plan-level]
</pre>

The service name can be anything you want and the plan level is one of these options: free, bronze, silver, gold, platinum.

### Binding Your SendGrid Service ##

Bind your SendGrid service to your app, using the following command:
    
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service [service-name] [app-name]
</pre>

The service name should match the one you provisioned above and the app name should be an existing Cloud Foundry app.

Once SendGrid has been added a username and password will be available. These are the credentials you use to access the newly provisioned SendGrid service instance.

## <a id='using'></a>Using SendGrid within your Application ##

Once a SendGrid service instance has been bound to your application, the [VCAP_SERVICES Environment Variable](../../../using/services/environment-variable.html) will be automatically updated to include your credentials. The section of `VCAP_SERVICES` that pertains to SendGrid will look like this:


    {
      sendgrid-n/a: [
        {
          name: "mysendgrid",
          label: "sendgrid-n/a",
          plan: "free",
          credentials: {
            hostname: "smtp.sendgrid.net",
            username: "QvsXMbJ3rK",
            password: "HCHMOYluTv"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

The getting started guide has more background on [using service instances with your application](../../adding-a-service.html#using).


## <a id='sample-app'></a>Sample Applications ##

With the SendGrid service provisioned and credentials added to the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, you can now use SendGrid within your applications. You can either use SMTP with your SendGrid credentials or one of the many [SendGrid libraries](http://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html).

### Java ###

This Java program will build a multi-part MIME email and send it through SendGrid. Java already has built in libraries to send and receive emails. This example uses [javamail] (https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home).

```java
    import javax.mail.*;
    import javax.mail.internet.*;
    import javax.mail.Authenticator;
    import javax.mail.PasswordAuthentication;
    import java.util.Properties;
     
    public class SimpleMail {
     
        private static final String SMTP_HOST_NAME = “smtp.sendgrid.net”;
        private static final String SMTP_AUTH_USER = “<sendgrid_username>”;
        private static final String SMTP_AUTH_PWD  = “<sendgrid_password>”;
     
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
           new SimpleMail().test();
        }
     
        public void test() throws Exception{
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put(“mail.transport.protocol”, “smtp”);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.host”, SMTP_HOST_NAME);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.port”, 587);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.auth”, “true”);
     
            Authenticator auth = new SMTPAuthenticator();
            Session mailSession = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, auth);
            // uncomment for debugging infos to stdout
            // mailSession.setDebug(true);
            Transport transport = mailSession.getTransport();
     
            MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage(mailSession);
     
            Multipart multipart = new MimeMultipart(“alternative”);
     
            BodyPart part1 = new MimeBodyPart();
            part1.setText(“This is multipart mail and u read part1……”);
     
            BodyPart part2 = new MimeBodyPart();
            part2.setContent(”<b>This is multipart mail and u read part2……</b>”, “text/html”);
     
            multipart.addBodyPart(part1);
            multipart.addBodyPart(part2);
     
            message.setContent(multipart);
            message.setFrom(new InternetAddress(“me@myhost.com”));
            message.setSubject(“This is the subject”);
            message.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO,
                 new InternetAddress(“someone@somewhere.com”));
     
            transport.connect();
            transport.sendMessage(message,
                message.getRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO));
            transport.close();
        }
     
        private class SMTPAuthenticator extends javax.mail.Authenticator {
            public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
               String username = SMTP_AUTH_USER;
               String password = SMTP_AUTH_PWD;
               return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
            }
        }
    }
```
A sample application for using Spring Framework and SendGrid on Cloud Foundry can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-sendgrid).

### Ruby on Rails ###

You can quickly get started with SendGrid using Ruby on Rails ActionMailer.

First, get SendGrid credentials from `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable

```ruby
    credentials = host = username = password = ''
    if !ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'].blank?
      JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']).each do |k,v|
        if !k.scan("sendgrid").blank?
          credentials = v.first.select {|k1,v1| k1 == "credentials"}["credentials"]
          host = credentials["hostname"]
          username = credentials["username"]
          password = credentials["password"]
        end
      end
    end
```    

You will also need to edit the ActionMailer settings in `config/environment.rb`:

```ruby
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address => '<smtp_host>',
      :port => '587',
      :authentication => :plain,
      :user_name => '<sendgrid_username>',
      :password => '<sendgrid_password>',
      :domain => 'yourdomain.com',
      :enable_starttls_auto => true
    }
```
A sample application for using Ruby on Rails and SendGrid on Cloud Foundry can be found [here](https://github.com/laur-craciun/sendgrid-cloudfoundry-rails).
