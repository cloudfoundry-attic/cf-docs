title: Catalog Metadata
---

The service marketplace is defined as the aggregate catalog of services and
plans advertised to a Cloud Foundry instance by all registered brokers.
Cloud controller clients (web, CLI, helper libraries, etc) have different
requirements for information about these services and plans that should be
displayed to end users.
In this document, "client" refers to clients of cloud controller.

As described in the [Service Broker API](api.html#catalog-mgmt), the only
required user-facing fields are `label` and `description` for services, and
`name` and `description` for service plans.
Rather than attempt to anticipate all potential fields that clients will want,
or add endless fields to the API spec over time, CF provides a mechanism for
brokers to advertise any fields a client requires.
This mechanism is the `metadata` field.

The contents of the `metadata` field are not validated by cloud controller but
may be by cloud controller clients.
Not all clients will make use of the value of `metadata`, and not all brokers
have to provide it.
If a broker does advertise the `metadata` field, client developers can choose to
display some or all fields available.

**Note**: in the [v1 broker API](api-v1.html), the `metadata` field is called
`extra`.

## <a id='community-driven-standards'></a>Community-Driven Standards ##

The intent of this page is to provide a list of metadata fields consumed by
popular clients.
Client authors can add their metadata requirements to this document, so that
broker authors can see what metadata they should advertise in their catalogs.
**Before adding new fields, consider whether an existing one will suffice.**

**Note**: “CLI strings” are all lowercase, no spaces.
Keep it short; imagine someone having to type it as an argument for a longer CLI
command.

| Broker API Field | Type | Description | CC API Field | Pivotal CLI | Pivotal Developer Console |

Each object must provide the following keys:<br/>`amount: { usd: float }, unit: string `<br/>This indicates the cost in USD of the service plan, and how frequently the cost is occurred, such as “MONTHLY” or “per 1000 messages”. | extra.costs | | X |

The example below contains a catalog of one service, having one service plan.
Of course, a broker can offering a catalog of many plans, each having many
plans.
