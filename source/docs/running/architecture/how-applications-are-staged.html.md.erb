 1. At the command line, the user goes into the directory holding their application and uses the cf command line tool to issue a push command.

 2. The cf command line tool tells CCNG to create a record for the application.

 3. CCNG stores the application metadata (e.g. the app name, number of instances the user specified, the buildpack and stack).

 4. The cf command line tool uploads the application files

 5. CCNG stores the raw application files in the blobstore.

 6. The cf command line tool issues an app start command.

 7. Because the app has not already been staged, CCNG chooses a DEA instance from the DEA pool to stage the application. The staging DEA uses the instructions in the buildpack to stage the application.

 8. The staging DEA streams the output of the staging process so the developer can troubleshoot application staging problems.

 9. The staging DEA packages up the resulting staged application into a tar ball called a "droplet" and stores it in the blobstore. The results are cached and used next time the application is staged.

 10. The staging DEA reports to CCNG that staging is complete.

 11. CCNG chooses one or more DEAs from the pool to run the staged application.

 12. The running DEAs report back the status of the application to CCNG.
