title: Deployment of BOSH on AWS
---

This step will leverage the new Elastic IP created in [Configuring AWS for BOSH](/docs/running/deploying-cf/aws-ec2/configure_aws_bosh.html), Security Group and Key Pair file that we created in [Configuring AWS for Micro BOSH](/docs/running/deploying-cf/aws-ec2/configure_aws_micro_bosh.html) to deploy a BOSH server on AWS in four steps:

**Note:** CF may be deployed straight from Micro BOSH but this is typically not considered a reliable method and so it is not discussed here.


1. Create Directory Structure

2. Create BOSH Deployment Manifest

3. Locate the correct BOSH Stemcell

4. Deploy Manifest

The original source of this information was from the [cloud foundry blog post](http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2012/09/06/deploying-to-aws-using-cloud-foundry-bosh/).

### Obtain and Upload Release

Simply upload the most recent generic release

<pre class="terminal">
bosh upload release https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/release/bosh-1274.tgz</td>
</pre>


### Create Directory Structure

Create a standard place to store the Deployment Manifest on your local computer, you should still be targeting the Micro BOSH server:

<pre class="terminal">
  mkdir -p ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh
  cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh
  touch bosh.yml
</pre>


**Locate the correct BOSH Stemcell**

It is important to deploy the correct AWS image that is compatible with the version of BOSH you will be installing, these are updated over time.

To find and obtain the current BOSH stemcell, navigate to [http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io](http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io) and right click on "Download" and Copy Link for “bosh (aws xen ubuntu)” tarball file (.tar.gz).  An example of the link URL is:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz)

![image alt text](/images/aws-ec2/image_25.png)

Upload the latest stemcell of BOSH onto the Micro BOSH server.

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh upload stemcell https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>


After the upload is complete you can see the list of stemcells by calling:
<pre class="terminal">
  bosh stemcells
</pre>


**Create BOSH Deployment Manifest**

Now let’s review what the contents of the bosh.yml deployment manifest file should include. Notice the first comment in the
example file.  You'll need to replace that uuid with the one for the resuts of the command

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh status
</pre>

~~~yaml

# The director_uuid is obtained by executing the "bosh status" command.

Save your changes to the file.

### Deploy Manifest

Everything is now in place to use the deployment manifest you have created and deploy BOSH to AWS (the first inception). Let’s now do this.

Enter the deployments folder you created earlier:

<pre class="terminal">
  cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments
</pre>


Select the deployment you called "bosh" in the first section of [Configuring AWS for BOSH](/docs/running/deploying-cf/aws-ec2/configure_aws_bosh.html)

<pre class="terminal">
bosh deployment bosh/bosh.yml
</pre>


Deploy the BOSH

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh deploy
</pre>

If the deployment failed clean it up before trying again. This command will take awhile. You will also have several instances running in EC2 while this happens. These extra instances are used to distribute the compilation of packages needed for your BOSH virtual machine. You can control the number of compilation workers in teh bosh.yml file we created above.

<pre class="terminal">
bosh delete deployment bosh
</pre>


Log into the new BOSH server, replace the IP address for the IP address you created in Step 4 with the one used below.

<pre class="terminal">
bosh target 23.21.249.15
</pre>

The default username and password are "admin" and “admin”.

If the deployment ran successfully you will have a BOSH instance deployed onto AWS

Note a few things in the preceding screenshot:

![image alt text](/images/aws-ec2/image_26.png)

1. **bosh** - the name of the instance will match the deployment name

2. **us-east-1a** - this is the availability zone that was in the deployment manifest

3. **bosh** - this was the name of the Key Pair

4. **bosh** - this was the name of the Security Group

5. **23.21.249.15**- this was the Elastic IP address that we created and is the external IP address for the BOSH server
