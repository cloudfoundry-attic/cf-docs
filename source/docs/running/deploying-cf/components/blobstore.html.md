title: BOSH Components - Blobstore
---

The BOSH Blobstore is used to store the content of Releases (BOSH [Jobs](../reference/jobs.html.md) and [Packages](../reference/packages.html.md) in their source form as well as the compiled image of BOSH Packages.
[Releases](../reference/releases.html.md) are uploaded by the [BOSH CLI](../reference/bosh-cli.html.md) and inserted into the Blobstore by the [BOSH Director](director.html.md).
When you deploy a Release, BOSH will orchestrate the compilation of packages and store the result in the Blobstore.
When BOSH deploys a BOSH Job to a VM, the BOSH Agent will pull the specified Job and associated BOSH Packages from the Blobstore.

BOSH also uses the Blobstore as an intermediate store for large payloads, such as log files (see BOSH logs) and output from the BOSH Agent that exceeds the max size for messages over the message bus.

There are currently three Blobstores supported in BOSH:

1. [Atmos](http://www.emc.com/storage/atmos/atmos.htm)
1. [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
1. [simple blobstore server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/tree/master/simple_blobstore_server)

For example configurations of each Blobstore, see the Blobs section below . The default BOSH configuration uses the simple blobstore server, as the load is very light and low latency is preferred.

###Blobs
To create final releases you need to configure your release repository with a blobstore. This is where BOSH will upload the final releases to, so that the release can later be retreived from another computer.

To prevent the release repository from becoming bloated with large binary files (source tar-balls), large files can be placed in the blobs directory, and then uploaded to the blobstore.

For production releases you should use either the Atmos or S3 blobstore and configure them as described below.

####Atmos

Atmos is a shared storage solution from EMC. To use Atmos, edit config/final.tml and config/private.yml, and add the following (replacing the url, uid and secret with your account information):

File config/final.yml

    ---
    blobstore:
    provider: atmos
      options:
      tag: BOSH
      url: https://blob.cfblob.com
      uid: 1876876dba98981ccd091981731deab2/user1

File config/private.yml

    ---
    blobstore_secret: ahye7dAS93kjWOIpqla9as8GBu1=

####S3

To use S3, a shared storage solution from Amazon, edit config/final.tml and config/private.yml, and add the following (replacing the access_key_id, bucket_name, encryption_key and secret_access_key with your account information):

File config/final.yml

    ---
    blobstore:
      provider: s3
      options:
        access_key_id: KIAK876234KJASDIUH32
        bucket_name: 87623bdc
        encryption_key: sp$abcd123$foobar1234

File config/private.yml

    ---
    blobstore_secret: kjhasdUIHIkjas765/kjahsIUH54asd/kjasdUSf

####Local

If you are trying out BOSH and don't have an Atmos or S3 account, you can use the local blobstore provider (which stored the files on disk instead of a remote server).

File config/final.yml

    ---
    blobstore:
      provider: local
      options:
        blobstore_path: /path/to/blobstore/directory

Note that local should only be used for testing purposes as it can't be shared with others (unless they run on the same system).
