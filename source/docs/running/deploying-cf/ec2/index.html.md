Cloud Foundry tools simplify the process of deploying a Cloud Foundry instance to a variety of platforms, including Amazon Web Services. The following sections guide you through using BOSH and cf to deploy Cloud Foundry to Amazon Web Services.

## <a id='domain-prep'></a> Prepare a Domain ##

The first thing to do is to pick a DNS domain name for your Cloud Foundry instance. If you pick *cloud.mydomain.com*, your applications will be available as *app-name.cloud.mydomain.com*.

Create an AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone for your domain at the [Route 53 control panel](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53). The control panel shows you a "delegation set" - a list of addresses to which you must delegate DNS authority for your domain. If your domain is *cloud.mydomain.com*, each address in the delegation set should become an NS record in the DNS server for *mydomain.com*.

## <a id='deployment-env-prep'></a> Prepare the Deployment Environment ##

Ruby 1.9.3 and git (1.8 or later) are prerequisites for the following steps. After you install Ruby and git, install the `bundler` RubyGem:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gem install bundler
</pre>

Create a deployments directory with a subdirectory for your particular deployment. For example, `~/deployments/cf-example`. In the particular deployment's sub-directory, create a file named `Gemfile` with the following contents:

~~~
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby "1.9.3"

gem "bosh_cli_plugin_aws"
~~~

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd ~/deployments/cf-example
~/deployments/cf-example$ bundle install
</pre>

Next, set environment variables required for deploying to AWS. Create a file called `bosh_environment` and add the following, changing the value for each line to suit your configuration:

~~~
export BOSH_VPC_DOMAIN=mydomain.com
export BOSH_VPC_SUBDOMAIN=cloud # Pick something more unique than 'cloud' to work around a temporary shortcoming of the tool
export BOSH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
export BOSH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
export BOSH_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export BOSH_VPC_SECONDARY_AZ=us-east-1a # see note below
export BOSH_VPC_PRIMARY_AZ=us-east-1d   # see note below
~~~

*Note:* `BOSH_VPC_DOMAIN` and `BOSH_VPC_SUBDOMAIN` must correspond to the DNS domain name you set up when configuring Route 53. The values shown above correspond to the earlier Route 53 example of *cloud.mydomain.com*.

*Note:* Now only deployment to `us-east-1` region is supported by next
steps. For MicroBOSH deploy please review [following guide](https://gist.github.com/danhigham/5804252).

Choose availability zones that are listed as "operating normally" on
the [AWS Console Status Health Section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1)
for your region.

Use `source` to set them for the current shell:

<pre class="terminal">
~/deployments/cf-example$ source bosh_environment
</pre>

Run `bosh aws create` to create a VPC Internet Gateway, VPC subnets, 3 RDS databases, and a NAT VM for Cloud Foundry subnet routing. The command does not require user input, so start it and grab a coffee at the trendiest place across town! This command will generate receipt files that will be used later when deploying Cloud Foundry (`aws_rds_receipt.yml` and `aws_vpc_receipt.yml`)

<pre class="terminal">
~/cf$ bundle exec bosh aws create
Executing migration CreateKeyPairs
allocating 1 KeyPair(s)
Executing migration CreateVpc
. . .
details in S3 receipt: aws_rds_receipt and file: aws_rds_receipt.yml
Executing migration CreateS3
creating bucket xxxx-bosh-blobstore
creating bucket xxxx-bosh-artifacts
</pre>

**Note:** RDS database creation may take 20+ minutes to finish.


## <a id='deploy-microbosh'></a> Deploy Micro BOSH ##

Deploy Micro BOSH from the workspace directory, using the `bosh aws bootstrap micro` command:

<pre class="terminal">
~/deployments/cf-example$ bundle exec bosh aws bootstrap micro

WARNING! Your target has been changed to `https://10.10.0.6:25555'!

</pre>

## <a id='create-a-stub'></a>Create a Deployment Stub##

Cloud Foundry can now be deployed.

Create a stub file called `cf-aws-stub.yml` for spiff, we'll use this in a moment to generate a BOSH manifest for our CF deployment.

Replace placeholders with the approriate data:

- `PLACEHOLDER-DIRECTOR-UUID` - the bosh director UUID. You can get it by running `bundle exec bosh status`.

- `PLACEHOLDER-ACCESS-KEY-ID` and `PLACEHOLDER-SECRET-KEY` - AWS access key id and secret key. You can use the same ones as you used in the `bosh_environment` file above, or generate new ones.

- `PLACEHOLDER-AWS-AVAILABILITY-ZONE` and `PLACEHOLDER-AWS-AVAILABILITY-ZONE2` - `BOSH_VPC_PRIMARY_AZ` and `BOSH_VPC_SECONDARY_AZ` from the `bosh_environment` file above.

- `PLACEHOLDER-SUBNET-FOR-AZ1` and `PLACEHOLDER-SUBNET-FOR-AZ2` - Look in `~/deployments/cf-example/aws_vpc_receipt.yml` (this file was generated when you ran `bosh aws create`).  They are under 'subnets' 'cf1' and 'cf2'.

- `PLACEHOLDER-DOMAIN` - `BOSH_VPC_SUBDOMAIN.BOSH_VPC_DOMAIN` from the `bosh_environment` file above (hosted domain created in route 53).

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAADB-PROPERTIES`, `PLACEHOLDER-CCDB-PROPERTIES` - copy these from `~/deployments/cf-example/aws_rds_receipt.yml`

Generate secure keys for the following placeholders:

- `PLACEHOLDER-NATS-USER`

- `PLACEHOLDER-NATS-PASSWORD`

- `PLACEHOLDER-CC-DB-ENCRYPTION-KEY`

- `PLACEHOLDER-BULK-API-PASSWORD`

- `PLACEHOLDER-CC-STAGING-UPLOAD-USER`

- `PLACEHOLDER-CC-STAGING-UPLOAD-PASSWORD`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-LOGIN-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-DEVELOPER-CONSOLE-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-APP-DIRECT-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-SUPPORT-SERVICES-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-SERVICESMGMT-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CLIENTS-SPACE-MAIL-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-BATCH-USERNAME`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-BATCH-PASSWORD`

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-CC-CLIENT-SECRET`

- `PLACEHOLDER-ROUTER-STATUS-USER`

- `PLACEHOLDER-ROUTER-STATUS-PASSWORD`

- `PLACEHOLDER-LOGGREGATOR-SECRET`


Generate RSA key pair for:

- `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-JWT-SIGNING-KEY` and `PLACEHOLDER-UAA-JWT-VERIFICATION-KEY`

You can also replace the users username/password in uaa->scim->users list.


## <a id='deploy-cloudfoundry'></a>Deploy Cloud Foundry##

Clone `cf-release` into a convenient location, e.g. `~/releases/cf-release`

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git
</pre>

Update cf-release submodules. You can use helper script `update` in cf-release.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases$ cd cf-release
~/releases/cf-release$ ./update
</pre>

Install spiff using instructions from the [Spiff Readme](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff).

Generate a BOSH deployment manifest:

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ ./generate_deployment_manifest aws templates/cf-minimal-dev.yml ~/deployments/cf-example/cf-aws-stub.yml > ~/deployments/cf-example/cf.yml
</pre>

Deploy CF using BOSH.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle install
</pre>

Check that you are still targetted at your new bosh director.
<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle exec bosh target
Current target is https://x.x.x.x:25555 (micro-xxxxxx)
</pre>
If this doesn't match then name of your deployed micro bosh you can target director using IP from `~/deployments/micro/micro_bosh.yml`.

Set your deployment to the generated manifest
<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle exec bosh deployment ~/deployments/cf-example/cf.yml
</pre>

Create a Cloud Foundry release. It will prompt you for a development release name.  You can use `cf` which was specified in deployment manifest under releases->name.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle exec bosh create release
</pre>

Upload the generated release to the BOSH director.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle exec bosh upload release
</pre>

Deploy the uploaded Cloud Foundry release.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ bundle exec bosh deploy
</pre>

This process can take some time (2-3 hours), especially during its first run when all the jobs are compiled for the first time. If `bosh deploy` fails, it's *usually possible to rerun it again*.

To test Cloud Foundry installation test the API endpoint.

<pre class="terminal">
~/releases/cf-release$ curl api.subdomain.domain/info
</pre>

If that is successful it should return the information as json. Otherwise, check your networking. *Tip* - make sure your domain has an NS record for your subdomain.

At this point it should be possible to target the install with [gcf](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) and login as an administrator with the user name `admin` and the password `the_admin_pw` used in the deployiment manifest under uaa->scim->users. For more information about managing organizations, spaces, and users and applications go to the [gcf](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) page.

If you want to update your deploy of cf-release to reflect changes in the cf-release directory you can run `bosh create release && bosh upload release && bosh deploy` again. If you only have changes in your manifest you can just run `bosh deploy`.

## <a id='deploy-cloudfoundry-services'></a>Deploy Cloud Foundry Services##

If you want your Cloud Foundry to be able to provision services you would need to deploy services release. Check the instructions on how to create a service broker [here](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/architecture/services/writing-service.html).

You also might be interested in checking out [community managed services release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-services-contrib-release).

## <a id='destroy-environment'></a>Destroying the AWS Environment ##

  </td></tr></table>

You also want to cleanup any YAML artifacts that are no longer valid:

<pre class="terminal">
~/deployments/cf-example$ bundle exec bosh aws destroy
~/deployments/cf-example$ rm -f *.yml
</pre>
