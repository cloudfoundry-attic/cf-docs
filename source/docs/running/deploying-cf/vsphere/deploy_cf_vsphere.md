title: Deploying Cloud Foundry with BOSH
---

This guide describes the process for deploying Cloud Foundry to a vSphere environment using BOSH.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

* BOSH should be deployed. See the steps in the [previous section](deploying_bosh_with_micro_bosh.html).

## <a id="target"></a>Target New BOSH Director ##

Target the Director of the deployed BOSH using `bosh target` and the IP address of the Director.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh target 172.20.134.52
$ bosh status
Updating director data... done

Director
  Name      your-director
  URL       http://172.20.134.52:25555
  Version   0.7 (release:fb1aebb0 bosh:20f2ca20)

  UUID      2250612f-f0e4-41b3-b1b2-3d730e9011a7

  dns       disabled

Deployment

</pre>

## <a id="upload-stemcell"></a>Upload a Stemcell ##

The Director needs a stemcell in order to deploy Cloud Foundry. Use the existing public stemcell in your `~/stemcells` directory. Do not use the Micro BOSH stemcell.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload stemcell ~/stemcells/bosh-stemcell-latest-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
Verifying stemcell...
File exists and readable                                     OK

## <a id="get-release"></a>Get a Cloud Release ##

For this exercise, we'll use a release from the public repository:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone git@github.com:cloudfoundry/cf-release.git
$ cd cf-release
$ bosh upload release releases/appcloud-129.yml # use the highest number available - inspecting the files in this directory
</pre>

You'll see a flurry of output as BOSH configures and uploads release components.

<!---  Gabi and Matt stopped here until Monday :) -->

## <a id="create-manifest"></a>Create a Cloud Deployment Manifest ##

For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll use a sample [deployment manifest](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml).

Keep in mind that a manifest of this size requires significant virtual hardware resources to run. According to the manifest file, you ideally need 72 vCPUs, 200GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage. The more IOPS you can throw at the deployment, the better.

Use the BOSH CLI to set your current deployment. This example assumes your deployment manifest file is in `~/deployments`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployment ~/deployments/cloudfoundry.yml
Deployment set to '/home/user/deployments/cloudfoundry.yml'
</pre>

## <a id="deploy"></a>Deploy Cloud Foundry ##

Now deploy Cloud Foundry using `bosh deploy`. This example shows only part of the expected output:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deploy
    Getting deployment properties from director...
	Unable to get properties list from director, trying without it...
	Compiling deployment manifest...
	Cannot get current deployment information from director, possibly a new deployment

</pre>

## <a id="verfy"></a>Verify the Deployment ##

Execute the `bosh vms` command to see all the vas deployed.

Output of this command will similar to the listing below. Make sure the "State" of all the jobs is "running".

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh vms
Deployment `cloudfoundry'

The Cloud Foundry deployment should now be ready to use. You can now follow the instructions in the [Using](/docs/using/index.html) section of these docs to install the [cf](/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html) command-line tool and push an application.
