title: Deploying BOSH with Micro BOSH
---

This guide describes the process for deploying BOSH as an application using micro BOSH. 

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

### <a id="microbosh"></a>Micro BOSH ###

Micro BOSH should be deployed and targeted. See the steps in [Deploying Micro BOSH](deploying_microbosh.html).

### <a id="stemcell"></a>BOSH Stemcell ###

A BOSH Stemcell should be uploaded to the Micro BOSH. See the steps in [Uploading a BOSH Stemcell](uploading_bosh_stemcell.html).

### <a id="openstack_floating_ip"></a>OpenStack Floating IPs ###

Allocate two new OpenStack Floating IP to your project. We will use it to access our Bosh Director and PowerDNS instances from outside of our network.

### <a id="create_release"></a>Create BOSH Release ###

Download the BOSH [source code](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh):

<pre class="terminal">
cd ~/bosh-workspace
git clone git://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh.git
</pre>

Create a new development BOSH Release:

<pre class="terminal">
cd ~/bosh-workspace/bosh
bundle install --local
bundle exec rake release:create_dev_release
</pre>

This command will output:

    bosh create release --force
    Syncing blobs...
    
    Building DEV release
    ---------------------------------

    ....

    Release version: 13.1-dev
    Release manifest: /Users/frodenas/bosh-workspace/bosh/release/dev_releases/bosh-13.1-dev.yml

###  <a id="upload_release"></a>Upload BOSH Release ###

Upload the BOSH Release generated previously to the Micro BOSH Director:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh upload release /Users/frodenas/bosh-workspace/bosh/release/dev_releases/bosh-13.1-dev.yml
</pre>

This command will output:

    Verifying release...
    File exists and readable                                     OK
    Extract tarball                                              OK
    Manifest exists                                              OK
    Release name/version                                         OK

    ...

    Release uploaded

To confirm that the BOSH Release has been loaded into your BOSH Director use the `bosh releases` command:

    +------+-----------+-------------+
    | Name | Versions  | Commit Hash |
    +------+-----------+-------------+
    | bosh | 13.1-dev  | 60c4acca+   |
    +------+-----------+-------------+
    (*) Currently deployed
    (+) Uncommitted changes
    
    Releases total: 1

### <a id="manifest_file"></a>Create manifest file ###

Using the `deployments` directory we created when we [deployed Micro BOSH](deploying_microbosh.html#manifest_file), create a `bosh-openstack` subdirectory:

<pre class="terminal">
mkdir -p ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh-openstack
cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh-openstack
</pre>

If you are using nova-network, copy the `dynamic` BOSH example manifest file: 

<pre class="terminal">
cp ~/bosh-workspace/bosh/release/examples/bosh-openstack-dynamic.yml bosh-openstack.yml
</pre>

If you are using the new [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/) service, copy the `manual` BOSH example manifest file: 

<pre class="terminal">
cp ~/bosh-workspace/bosh/release/examples/bosh-openstack-manual.yml bosh-openstack.yml
</pre>

Adapt the `bosh-openstack.yml` file to your environment settings. Search for the tag `# CHANGE`:

* The `director_uuid` option set the [Bosh Director](/docs/running/bosh/components/director.html) to use. We will use the Micro Bosh Director UUID. You can get it running the command `bosh status`.
* The `instance_type` option set the OpenStack flavor used for the compilation vms (at the `compilation` section) and jobs vms (at the `resource_pools` section). The `flavor_name` **must** have ephemeral disk (check the [validate your OpenStack](validate_openstack.html#ephemeral) guide). 
* The `allocated_floating_ip_1` and `allocated_floating_ip_2` allows us to associate a floating IP adress to the Director and PowerDNS instances and **must** be a previously allocated floating ips (check the [prerequisites](#openstack_floating_ip) section).
* The `dns.recursor` option set the IP address of the [recursor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Recursive_and_caching_name_server) to query in case PowerDNS can't resolve a hostname. We will use the `microbosh_ip_address`.
* The `auth_url` option set your [OpenStack identity](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-shared-services/) server.
* The `username`, `api_key` and `tenant` options sets your OpenStack credentials.
* The `region` option is optional, and allows you to set the OpenStack region to be used.
* The `default_security_groups` option set the security groups used by vms, and **must** be existing security groups. We will use the `microbosh_security_group` we created when we [deployed Micro Bosh](deploying_microbosh.html#openstack_security_groups).
* The `default_key_name` option set the key pair used by vms and **must** be an existing keypair. We will use the `microbosh_keypair` we created when we [deployed Micro Bosh](deploying_microbosh.html#openstack_keypairs).

If you are using the new [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/) component, you must also adapt the below settings:    

* The `range` option sets the IP range to use. `subnet_cidr` **must** be a [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) belonging to one of the network subnets set in `net_id`.
* The `gateway` option sets subnet gateway.
* The `reserved` option sets the range of IP addresses (starting at `first_reserved_ip_address` and ending at `last_reserved_ip_address`) that are reserved (so BOSH/OpenStack will not use them when assigning dynamically IP to vms).
* The `static` option sets range of IP addresses (starting at `first_ip_address_for_vms` and ending at `last_ip_address_for_vms`) that are reserved to be set statically at the jobs section (so BOSH/OpenStack will not use them when assigning dynamically IP to vms).
* The `net_id` option sets the OpenStack network to use. `network_uuid` **must** be an existing Network UUID (you can list your OpenStack networks using the command `quantum net-list`).      
* The `ip_address_for_natsl`, `ip_address_for_redis`, `ip_address_for_postgres`, `ip_address_for_powerdns`, `ip_address_for_blobstore`, `ip_address_for_director`, `ip_address_for_registry` and `ip_address_for_health_monitor` sets the IP address to assign to each job. These IP addresses **must** in the range of IP addresses set previously in the  `static` option. 

### <a id="deploy"></a>Deploy BOSH ###

Set the BOSH deployment file to use:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh deployment ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh-openstack/bosh-openstack.yml
</pre>

This command will output:

    Deployment set to `/Users/frodenas/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh-openstack/bosh-openstack.yml'

Deploy the Full BOSH:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh deploy
</pre>

This command will output:

## <a id="test_bosh"></a>Testing your BOSH ##

### <a id="bosh_target"></a>Set target ###

To set your BOSH target use the `target` command:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh target &lt;bosh_ip_address&gt;
</pre>

This command will ask for the admin credentials. Enter `admin` when prompted for both `username` and `password`.

    Target set to `bosh'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as `admin'

### <a id="bosh_create_user"></a>Create a new user ###

To create a new user use the `create user` command:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh create user
Enter new username: frodenas
Enter new password: ********
Verify new password: ********
User `frodenas' has been created
</pre>

Then you can login with the new user credentials:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh login
Your username: frodenas
Enter password: ********
Logged in as `frodenas'
</pre>

The `admin` user will be deleted.

### <a id="bosh_status"></a>Check status ###

To check the status of your BOSH use the `status` command:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh status
</pre>

This command will output:

    Config
                 /Users/frodenas/.bosh_config

You can ssh using the `bosh ssh jobname/index` command.
 
Then you can sudo to get root privileges (default password for root user is `c1oudc0w`). All BOSH data is located at `/var/vcap` directory.

If you want to change the default root password, add this section at the [manifest](#manifest_file) file before deploying BOSH:

~~~yaml
env:
  bosh:
    password: <hash_password>
~~~

* `hash_password` **must** be a [sha-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashed password (You can generate it using the [mkpasswd](https://www.mkpasswd.net/) utility).

## <a id="delete_bosh"></a>Deleting your BOSH ##

If you want to delete your BOSH deployment, target your Micro BOSH and set the BOSH deployment file:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh target <microbosh_ip_address>
bosh deployment ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh-openstack/bosh-openstack.yml
</pre>

Then use the `delete deployment` command:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh delete deployment bosh-openstack
</pre>

This command will output:

    You are going to delete deployment `bosh-openstack'.
    
    THIS IS A VERY DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION AND IT CANNOT BE UNDONE!
