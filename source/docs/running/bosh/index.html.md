title: BOSH

BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of large-scale distributed services.

BOSH was developed to deploy Cloud Foundry, however it has a more general purpose - it can be used to deploy other distributed services. BOSH can deploy these services on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers such as VMware vSphere, vCloud Director, Amazon Web Services EC2, and OpenStack.

These sections describe the architecture, topology, configuration, and use of BOSH, as well as the structure and conventions used in packaging and deployment.
