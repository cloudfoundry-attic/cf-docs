title: BOSH
---

Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of large-scale distributed services. These sections describe the architecture, topology, configuration, and use of BOSH, as well as the structure and conventions used in packaging and deployment.

BOSH was originally developed in the context of the Cloud Foundry Application Platform as a Service. However, the framework is general purpose, and you can use it to deploy other distributed services on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products such as VMware vSphere, vCloud Director, Amazon Web Services EC2, and OpenStack.
