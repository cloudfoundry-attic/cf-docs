The Director is the core orchestrating component in BOSH. It controls creation of VMs, deployment, and other life cycle events of software and services. Command and control is handed over to the the Director-Agent interaction after the CPI has created resources.

Specific subcomponents manage the tasks mentioned above. These components are instances of the following classes referenced from the ApiController.
