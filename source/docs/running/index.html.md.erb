###Deploying Cloud Foundry
There are a handful of ways to deploy Cloud Foundry. [BOSH](deploying-cf/index.html) is the recommended and supported means of deployment and allows operations people to consume publicly available releases. An alternative is to use a [community developed deployment script via Chef](deploying-cf-with-chef). For simple testing and local development, there is [Micro Cloud Foundry](micro_cloud_foundry/index.html).
